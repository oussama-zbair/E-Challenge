     * You will be given an integer array and a threshold value. The threshold represents the
     * maximum length of subarrays that may be created for the challenge. Each subarray
     * created has a cost equal to the maximum integer within the subarray. Partition the entire
     * array into subarrays with lengths less than or equal to the threshold, and do it at a
     * minimum cost. The subarrays are to be chosen from contiguous elements, and the given
     * array must remain in its original order.
     * Example
     * arr = [1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6]
     * threshold = 3
     * Here are some ways to partition the arrays as an example. The lengths of partitions can
     * differ as long as none are longer than threshold.
     * • Partition into 6 subarrays of length 1 as [1], [3], [4], [5], [2], [6]. The total cost is 1+3+4+5+2+6
     * = 21.
     * • Partition into 4 subarrays of various lengths: [1, 3], [4], [5], [2, 6]. The total cost is 3 +4 +5 +6 =
     * 18.
     * • Partition into 3 subarrays of length 2 as: [1, 3], [4, 5], [2, 6]. The total cost is 3 + 5+ 6 = 14
     * • Partition into 2 subarrays of length 3 as: [1, 3, 4], [5, 2, 6]. The total cost is 4 + 6 = 10.
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * The optimal cost is 10.
     * Function Description
     * Complete the function calculateCost in the editor below.
     * calculateCost has the following parameter(s):
     * int arr[n]: the integer array to be divided into subarrays
     * int threshold: the threshold value, i.e the maximum size of any subarray
     * Returns
     * int: the minimum cost to partition the array
     * Constraints
     * 1 ≤n≤5000
     * 1 ≤ threshold ≤ 500
     * 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 100000
